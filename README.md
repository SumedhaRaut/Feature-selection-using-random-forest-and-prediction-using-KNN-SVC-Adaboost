# Feature-selection-using-random-forest-and-prediction-using-KNN-SVC-Adaboost
This repository showcases a complete machine learning pipeline for the Bank Marketing UCI dataset, predicting term deposit subscriptions. Key highlights:  Pipeline Overview
## Pipeline Overview
Data Preprocessing: Categorical encoding (LabelEncoder), StandardScaler normalization

Feature Selection: Random Forest importance ranking to select optimal features

Model Comparison: KNN, SVC, AdaBoost classifiers on selected features

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score on test set

## Key Learnings
Random Forest feature selection effectively reduced dimensionality while maintaining model performance

KNN outperformed on balanced metrics for this imbalanced classification problem

Production-ready baseline for hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods

Perfect for data science portfolios, interview prep, and ML model selection demonstrations!
